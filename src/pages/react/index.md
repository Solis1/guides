## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application. It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. And it's flexible: React works with the libraries and frameworks that you already know.

To describe component's DOM representations, React uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.

## Advantages of React

Some reasons to use React are:

1. Fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.
2. Modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. React's modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript's [maintainability problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code).
3. Scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.
4. Flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. People are still figuring out React's potential. [There's room to explore](https://medium.mybridge.co/22-amazing-open-source-react-projects-cb8230ec719f).
